# Mime

A comprehensive, compact MIME type module.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/broofa/mime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/broofa/mime)

## Version 2 Notes

Version 2 is a breaking change from 1.x as the semver implies.  Specifically:

* `lookup()` renamed to `getType()`
* `extension()` renamed to `getExtension()`
* `charset()` and `load()` methods have been removed

If you prefer the legacy version of this module please `npm install mime@^1`.  Version 1 docs may be found [here](https://github.com/broofa/mime/tree/v1.4.0).

## Install

### NPM
```
npm install mime
```

### Browser

It is recommended that you use a bundler such as
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to
package your code.  However, browser-ready versions are available via wzrd.in.
E.g. For the full version:

    <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/mime@latest"></script>
    <script>
    mime.getType(...); // etc.
    </script>

Or, for the `mime/lite` version:

    <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/mime%2flite@latest"></script>
    <script>
    mimelite.getType(...); // (Note `mimelite` here)
    </script>

## Quick Start

For the full version (800+ MIME types, 1,000+ extensions):

```javascript
const mime = require('mime');

mime.getType('txt');                    // ⇨ 'text/plain'
mime.getExtension('text/plain');        // ⇨ 'txt'
```

See [Mime API](#mime-api) below for API details.

## Lite Version

There is also a "lite" version of this module that omits vendor-specific
(`*/vnd.*`) and experimental (`*/x-*`) types.  It weighs in at ~2.5KB, compared
to 8KB for the full version.  To load the lite version:

```javascript
const mime = require('mime/lite');
```

## Mime .vs. mime-types .vs. mime-db modules

For those of you wondering about the difference between these [popular] NPM modules,
here's a brief rundown ...

[`mime-db`](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db) is "the source of
truth" for MIME type information.  It is not an API.  Rather, it is a canonical
dataset of mime type definitions pulled from IANA, Apache, NGINX, and custom mappings
submitted by the Node.js community.

[`mime-types`](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types) is a thin
wrapper around mime-db that provides an API drop-in compatible(ish) with `mime @ < v1.3.6` API.

`mime` is, as of v2, a self-contained module bundled with a pre-optimized version
of the `mime-db` dataset.  It provides a simplified API with the following characteristics:

* Intelligently resolved type conflicts (See [mime-score](https://github.com/broofa/mime-score) for details)
* Method naming consistent with industry best-practices
* Compact footprint.  E.g. The minified+compressed sizes of the various modules:

Module | Size
--- | ---
`mime-db`  | 18 KB
`mime-types` | same as mime-db
`mime` | 8 KB
`mime/lite` | 2 KB

## Mime API

Both `require('mime')` and `require('mime/lite')` return instances of the MIME
class, documented below.
